A few years ago, I led the development of a web application that grew to serve more than 20,000 people daily. That experience taught me two things: how to build technology that actually scales, and how much the right software can transform a business.

But I also noticed something else: many startups and businesses in India struggled to find the right tech partner. They either got stuck with overpriced agencies or with freelancers who couldn’t deliver at scale.

That’s why I founded Desi Script, a software house built with one goal in mind: to give businesses startup-friendly, expert-level technology services they can trust. Today, we help companies build websites, apps, and digital solutions that don’t just work, but actually grow with their business.
